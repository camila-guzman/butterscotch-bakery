          Butterscotch Bakery was inspired by our family's long histories with
          baking in the Cotswolds in the 1930â€™s. We are presently raising the
          6th era of yearning bakers.We trust that handcrafted baked goods
          ought to be accessible to everybody. And a unique seasonal drink
          couldn't hurt. At our pastry kitchen in Chipping Sodbury our master
          group of dough punchers deliver an excellent scope of brilliant
          breads, baked goods and sweet shop. Brought into the world with
          flour on their fingers, neighbors and life-long friends Sabina and
          Amelia convey their instilled energy for learning and teaching the
          art of bakery, to keep on being at the front line of creative
          advancement in our community, and guarantee that there is a strong
          future for genuine baked goods made by genuine bakers!
